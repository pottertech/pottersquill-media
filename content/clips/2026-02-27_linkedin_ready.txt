Smartphones have been boring for years.

Same slab of glass. Slightly better camera. Incrementally faster chip. We've hit a plateau where the $400 phone does everything the $1400 phone does.

Samsung's S26? It's fine. It's good, even. But it's not *different*.

Here's what caught my attention at MWC 2026:

Foldable gaming handhelds. Phones that unfold into mini Nintendo Switches. Rollable screens. Dual-hinged designs that make you do a double-take.

Will anyone buy them? Probably not.

Do I want to try one? Absolutely.

The smartphone industry needs this. When devices get weird, companies take risks. When they take risks, someone eventually figures out what actually works.

Remember how foldables were a joke three years ago? Now they're just another option.

We've had a decade of iteration. It's time for some experimentation.

What's your take — are weird phones the future or just a gimmick?
