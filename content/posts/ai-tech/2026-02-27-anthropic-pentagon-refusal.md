Most AI companies are racing to land military contracts. Anthropic just walked away from one.

## The Refusal

Wired reported this week that Anthropic declined Pentagon terms over lethal autonomous weapons. They couldn't agree on language around AI systems making kill decisions.

This is notable because:

- Anthropic was in talks (they wanted the contract)
- The Pentagon wanted more flexibility
- Anthropic drew a line: no AI making lethal decisions without human oversight

## Why This Is Unusual

Every major AI company is chasing defense money right now:

- OpenAI works with the Pentagon (changed their policy to allow it)
- Google has cloud contracts with the military
- Microsoft has massive defense deals

Anthropic had every economic incentive to say yes. They said no anyway.

## The Ethics Question

There's a real debate here:

**Pro-military AI:** Faster decisions, fewer human casualties, precision targeting
**Against:** Delegating kill decisions to machines, slippery slope to autonomous warfare

Anthropic's stance: we'll work with you, but not on systems that decide to kill without humans.

## My Take

This is probably the right call, but it's complicated.

Yes, autonomous weapons are terrifying. Yes, we need human accountability for lethal force. Yes, Anthropic drawing a line matters.

But also: they're a for-profit company. This stance costs money. It may cost them market position if competitors say yes.

I respect that they said no *anyway*.

## The Bigger Picture

This is happening while:
- Congress debates AI regulation (slowly)
- The EU is ahead on AI safety rules
- No international consensus on autonomous weapons exists

Anthropic's move doesn't solve anything. But it puts a marker down: not every AI company will take every military dollar.

## What This Means for You

If you're using Claude (Anthropic's AI), you now know where they stand. They're willing to leave money on the table for ethical lines.

Whether you agree with their specific line or not, the fact that they *have* one is rare in this industry.

**The question:** Should AI companies work with the Pentagon at all? And if they do, where's the line?

I don't have a clean answer. Neither does Anthropic, apparently. But at least they're asking the question instead of just cashing the checks.

What's your take — are they principled or naive?
