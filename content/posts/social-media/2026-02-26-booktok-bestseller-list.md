BookTok has become the single biggest driver of book sales. Not publishers. Not critics. Not the Times bestseller list. TikTok users filming themselves crying over plot twists.

## The Numbers

- 77 billion views on #BookTok
- Books that go viral on TikTok sell out in bookstores within days
- Publishers now monitor TikTok trends when deciding print runs
- Some books published years ago are hitting bestseller lists because of TikTok rediscovery

## Why It Works

| Traditional Discovery | BookTok Discovery |
|----------------------|-------------------|
| Editorial reviews | Emotional reactions |
| Author reputation | Relatable reactions |
| Critical analysis | "This book destroyed me" |
| Book covers | Unboxing videos |
| Literary prizes | "Books that made me sob at 3am" |

People trust other readers more than critics. A teenager crying on camera sells more books than a New York Times review.

## How It Changes Publishing

**Before:** Publisher decides what's important. Marketing pushes to bookstores and critics. Readers find out through traditional media.

**Now:** Readers decide what's important. TikTok drives demand. Publishers scramble to print more copies. Bookstores can't keep up.

## The Dark Side

- Algorithmic taste: What's popular becomes more popular. Niche books stay niche.
- Emotional manipulation: Content that produces strong reactions (tears, anger) gets shared more than thoughtful analysis.
- Speed: A book can go from unknown to sold out in 48 hours. Supply chains can't keep up.

## What This Means for Authors

Traditional book tours? Less important. Having a TikTok presence? Critical.

Authors are now expected to be content creators. Post about their writing process. Share excerpts. Do emotional reactions to their own books.

This isn't optional anymore. If you're not on BookTok, your book might not get discovered.

## The Trend

BookTok is the "social-media" trend I'm tracking. It's changed how books get discovered and sold. Publishers are scrambling to adapt.

I don't have an opinion on whether this is good or bad for books. But it's definitely changed the game.
