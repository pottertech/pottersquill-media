Here's something wild: BookTok has become the biggest driver of book sales. Not publishers. Not critics. Not the Times bestseller list. TikTok users filming themselves crying over plot twists.

## The Numbers Are Absurd

- **77 billion views** on #BookTok
- Viral books sell out within days
- Publishers now monitor TikTok to decide print runs
- Books from years ago hit bestseller lists because of TikTok rediscovery

A teenager crying on camera sells more copies than a New York Times review. That's where we are.

## Old vs New Discovery

**Traditional:** Editorial reviews, author reputation, critical analysis, book covers, literary prizes.

**BookTok:** Emotional reactions, relatable content, "This book destroyed me," unboxing videos, "Books that made me sob at 3am."

People trust other readers more than critics. The messy, emotional, human reactions beat polished reviews every time.

## How Publishing Changed

**Before:** Publishers decided what mattered, pushed to bookstores and critics, readers found out through traditional media.

**Now:** Readers decide what matters. TikTok drives demand. Publishers scramble for more copies. Bookstores can't keep up.

The power flipped. Readers are in charge now.

## The Downsides

**Algorithmic taste:** What's popular gets more popular. Niche books stay invisible.

**Emotional manipulation:** Content that triggers strong reactions (tears, anger) spreads more than thoughtful analysis.

**Speed:** A book can go from unknown to sold out in 48 hours. Supply chains weren't built for this.

## What Authors Now Face

Traditional book tours? Less important. TikTok presence? Critical.

Authors are now expected to be content creators. Post about their process. Share excerpts. React emotionally to their own books.

This isn't optional. If you're not on BookTok, your book might not get discovered. Full stop.

## Is This Good or Bad?

I honestly don't know. Democratizing book discovery feels right. But algorithmic popularity has its own problems.

What I know: the game changed. Publishers are scrambling to catch up.
