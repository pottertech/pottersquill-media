## 🔥 HOT RIGHT NOW

### Baldur's Gate 1 & 2 Enhanced — Surprise Patch After 14 Years

**What**: Beamdog dropped patches for Baldur's Gate 1 and 2 Enhanced Editions  
**Why it matters**: 14 years later, still getting updates. 

> *Remember when games were finished at launch?*

This is the gaming equivalent of your 1998 Honda getting a recall notice in 2025. Except instead of "your airbag might kill you," it's "we fixed some bugs you didn't know existed."

**Gen X angle**: Baldur's Gate got more post-launch support than most 2024 games that are already dead.

### Space Marine 2 — Free Techmarine Class

**What**: New free class: Techmarine (engineer with sentry turret + axe) plus new PvE mission  
**The old way**: This would've been $15 DLC  
**The new way**: Just... included

We're so used to being monetized that "free update" sounds suspicious. What's the catch? There isn't one. They're just building goodwill the old-fashioned way.

### Marathon — Bungie's Server Slam

**What**: Bungie's return to Marathon (from the '90s), PvP extraction shooter, server slam underway  
**The problem**: Bungie says if you're not getting enough PvP action, "maybe you're just not looking for fights in the right places"

> *Marathon was a single-player Mac game in 1994. Now it's an "extraction shooter." We had LAN parties. Now we have server slams.*

The vectorheart aesthetic is gorgeous, though.

### Bloodborne Remake — FromSoftware Said No

**What**: Sony wanted to approve a Bloodborne remake. FromSoftware turned it down.  
**Translation**: They're busy with Elden Ring and have standards?

Unprecedented. A studio said no to easy money because they're working on something else. That's... rare.

---

### Stardew Valley 1.7 — Marry Clint (The Blacksmith)

**What**: Upcoming update finally lets you marry Clint  
**ConcernedApe's response**: "You've all been dying to marry Clint... right? ...guys?"

We've reached the "marry the NPC we made fun of for years" stage of game development. It's been a journey.

## Steam Highlights

**Direct3D Update** — opacity micromaps now official (dev tool, not player-facing but happy devs mean better games)

**Gloria Victis** — Medieval MMO that died in 2023 is back as free-to-play. Games don't die anymore, they hibernate.

**Steam Next Fest** — Top demos included gnomeslop, open world piracy, and cowboy robot wizards. Then Marathon happened.

## 📊 The Pattern

| What Was Promised | What We Got |
|-------------------|-------------|
| Finished games at launch | Day 1 patches forever |
| Expansion packs that expanded | DLC that unlocks the rest of the game |
| LAN parties with friends | Server slams with strangers |
| Games you owned | Games you license until the servers die |

**But also**: Baldur's Gate still being patched. Space Marine 2 giving away content. Some developers still care.
