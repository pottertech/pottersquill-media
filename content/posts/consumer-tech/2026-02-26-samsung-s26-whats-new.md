Samsung announced the S26 this week. I've been looking through the specs and early reviews. Here's what's real versus what's hype.

## The Actual Improvements

**Camera hardware got a bump.** The main sensor is larger. Low-light performance should be noticeably better based on the sensor size alone. Everything else is computational photography improvements, which Samsung's been good at for years.

**Battery is slightly bigger.** This translates to maybe 10-15% more real-world use. Not game-changing, but welcome.

**Screen brightness increased.** Useful if you use your phone outdoors a lot. Otherwise, you're not cranking brightness that high anyway.

## What's Just Marketing

"AI-enhanced everything." Samsung's using this phrase for basically every feature. Some of it is new. Some of it is just rebranded stuff from last year with better marketing.

The "Galaxy AI" features? Most are available on the S24 and S25 through software updates.

## What Nobody's Talking About

The S26 starts at $200 more than the S25 did at launch. Samsung's quietly moved the price point up while keeping the same storage tiers.

Also: no charger in the box. Still. At this price point.

## Would I Buy It?

If you're on an S23 or older, the camera improvements might justify it. If you're on S24 or S25, this is mostly a software update that happens to come with new hardware.

I'm not upgrading. My current phone works fine.

## The Real Trend

Samsung S26 is part of the "consumer-tech" trend I'm tracking. This category covers mobile launches, gadget reviews, and the gap between marketing claims and actual performance.
