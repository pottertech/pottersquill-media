Samsung announced the S26 this week. I've been poking through the specs and early reviews. Here's what's real versus what's marketing BS.

## Actual Improvements

**Camera got better.** Larger sensor. Low-light should be noticeably improved. Everything else is computational — which Samsung's been good at for years.

**Slightly bigger battery.** Maybe 10-15% more real-world use. Not game-changing, but welcome.

**Screen brighter.** Useful if you're outside a lot. Otherwise, you're not cranking brightness that high anyway.

## The Marketing

"AI-enhanced everything." They're using this for basically every feature. Some is new. Some is just last year's stuff with better branding.

Those "Galaxy AI" features? Most work on S24 and S25 through software updates.

## What They Didn't Say

S26 starts at $200 more than S25 did. Same storage tiers, higher price point.

Also: no charger in the box. Still. For this price.

## Would I Buy It?

If you're on S23 or older, the camera might justify it. If you're on S24 or S25, this is basically a software update that costs $1000+.

I'm not upgrading. My current phone works fine.

## The Real Story

Samsung S26 is part of the pattern: yearly phone launches where the marketing outpaces the hardware. They need you to believe you need this. You probably don't.
