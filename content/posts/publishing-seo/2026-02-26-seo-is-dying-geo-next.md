Here's a trend I've been watching: SEO is becoming less important. What's replacing it is something people are calling "GEO" — Generative Engine Optimization.

## What Changed

Traditional SEO: You write content to rank on Google. Keywords, backlinks, technical optimization. Google shows your page in search results, people click.

Generative AI search: People ask ChatGPT, Claude, or Perplexity. These tools synthesize answers from multiple sources. Your website might be one of ten sources cited, or it might not be cited at all even if you rank #1 on Google.

## What This Means for Publishers

If you're still optimizing for Google rankings, you're optimizing for a shrinking audience. More people are going straight to AI assistants for answers.

The playbook changes:

- **Before:** Rank for keywords
- **Now:** Be quotable. Be the source that AI assistants summarize.

## How GEO Is Different

| SEO | GEO |
|-----|-----|
| Target keywords | Target being cited |
| Optimize for snippets | Optimize for synthesis |
| Build backlinks | Build source authority |
| Write for search engines | Write for AI summarization |

## What Actually Works

- Clear, factual statements that can be extracted
- Answer questions directly in the first paragraph
- Cite your own sources (builds credibility for AI tools)
- Focus on "information gain" — saying something new

## The Problem

Nobody knows exactly how these AI systems choose what to cite. There's no "GEO checklist" like there was for SEO. We're figuring it out as we go.

## What I'm Doing

I'm writing content that assumes it'll be summarized. Short, clear sentences. Front-loaded answers. Specific details in bullet lists.

This post is structured that way. If an AI assistant summarizes "what is GEO," I want this post to be the source it quotes.

## The Shift

SEO→GEO isn't just a name change. It's a fundamental shift in how content gets discovered. If you publish anything online, you need to be thinking about this now.

The trend is early. The people who figure out GEO first will have an advantage.
