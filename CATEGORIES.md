## Writing Guidelines

1. **Always humanize** — Run content through humanizer skill before publishing
2. **Specific over vague** — "Samsung S26" beats "latest phone"
3. **Acknowledge tradeoffs** — Nothing is perfect, mention catches
4. **First person when natural** — "Here's what I found" vs. "It was discovered"
5. **No AI vocabulary** — Avoid: additionally, crucial, delve, pivotal, tapestry, underscores
6. **Link trends together** — AI writing (writing) + BookTok (social) + SEO shift (publishing)
